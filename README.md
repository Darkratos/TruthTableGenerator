# TruthTableGenerator

Small project done for my college to simplify creating Truth Tables of a logic expression.  
Dependencies: only 'tabulate' for now. Planning on adding excel support soon.  
  
The format goes as follows (without the quotes):  
'-': Biconditional  
'>': Conditional  
'&': And  
'!': Not  
'|': Or  
  
PS: If you have multiple operators of the same precedence (e.g. 'A&B&C'), you need to put parenthesis manually (e.g. 'A&(B&C)').
